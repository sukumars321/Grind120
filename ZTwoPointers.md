6. Move Zeros
    This is simple two pointer problem, but I could not solve it efficiently passing all edge cases, main idea is keeping track of where to move the nonzero elements which will move the zeros to right.

8. Valid Palindrome - https://algo.monster/liteproblems/125
    Another classic two pointer question, once we figure out how to convert and check if Characters are equal we are done with the problem.
