5. MeetingRooms
    This is precursor to merge intervals, this is pretty easy once we sort the 2D array based on start time.
    I need to remember how to sort 2D array on top of my mind. we can use build in sort or use bubble or selection sort other sorts would be way more complex

42. [57] Insert Interval - https://algo.monster/liteproblems/57
    This probelm extends mergeinterval and meeting room problem, we need to simply merge the overlaps and keep track of it in newInterval variable, Also I came up with a 5 step framework to approach the problems.

54. Meeting Rooms II - https://neetcode.io/solutions/meeting-rooms-ii    https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/2166045/line-sweep-algorithms
    This problem is based on sweep line algorithm, this can be solved using priorityQueue as well after sorting based on start time.

65. [54] Spiral Matrix - https://leetcode.com/problems/spiral-matrix/solutions/6118323/proof-beats-100-user-java-beginner-friendly-easy-explanation/
    I completly forgot the solution and approach to this problem. the solution implemented has less code but the standard can be found in the link.

66. [36] Valid Sudoku - https://algo.monster/liteproblems/36
    This is also simulation question with checking occurence using extra array space. see the solution.

67. [48] Rotate Image - https://algo.monster/liteproblems/48
    I was able to simulate this question but the usual solution is transpoin matrix.

68. [73] Set Matrix Zeroes - https://algo.monster/liteproblems/73   
    Another simulation questions, I was able to come up with logic but code implementation could be better. see algo solution for better code.
