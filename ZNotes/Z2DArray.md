5. MeetingRooms
    This is precursor to merge intervals, this is pretty easy once we sort the 2D array based on start time.
    I need to remember how to sort 2D array on top of my mind. we can use build in sort or use bubble or selection sort other sorts would be way more complex

42. [57] Insert Interval - https://algo.monster/liteproblems/57
    This probelm extends mergeinterval and meeting room problem, we need to simply merge the overlaps and keep track of it in newInterval variable, Also I came up with a 5 step framework to approach the problems.

54. Meeting Rooms II - https://neetcode.io/solutions/meeting-rooms-ii    https://leetcode.com/discuss/study-guide/2166045/line-sweep-algorithms
    This problem is based on sweep line algorithm, this can be solved using priorityQueue as well after sorting based on start time.
