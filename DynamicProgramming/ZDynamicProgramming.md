33. [70] Climbing Stairs - https://algo.monster/liteproblems/70
    I need revise my DP knowledge before moving any further, I got the bare recursion solution with bad code but it TLEed.
    after referring the solution i was able to write it myself.

    Updated the code with new learnings. now have basic understanding of DP.

35. [338] Counting Bits - https://algo.monster/liteproblems/338
    This literally has so many solution, and under the hood its DP question, so understanding the pattern is very important,  see the solution for different approaches

    I almost solved memo solution, the tabluation solution is too complex.

[198] House Robber - https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/solutions/6520686/house-robber-100-faster-memoization-tabulation-space-optimization/ 
    I was able to do recursive solution but memoization failed since i tried to top down the answer instead of building it from base case. its same as cliaming stairs if you look at it. better problem pen & papering needed.


[300] Longest Increasing Subsequence - https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/solutions/4509201/beats-99-users-c-java-python-javascript-2-dp-approaches-explained/
    The best approach is to solve it using recursion and then memoize the solution, directly applying Memo doesn't work.
