Step 1: Read the problem statement completely multiple times (~2 min)
    Figure out the problem type i.e. arrays, string manipualtion, DP, trees.

step 2: Break and Note down the constraints of the problem (~3 min)

step 3: Come up with Pesudo Solution/Code using different DS (~5 min)
    
step 4: Pen & Paper,  Dry run with multiple examples to iron out edge cases (~10 min)

step 5: Code actual solution with appropriate comments (~10 min)

Total : (~30 mins)
